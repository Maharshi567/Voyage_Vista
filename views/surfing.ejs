            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>One of the most famous and largest waves in the world is based in Nazare, Portugal. The fishing community is in the Oeste area of Portugal, in the Leiria District, in the ancient Estremadura province . Despite being famous among all the other surfing places around the world for decades, the spot didn’t earn widespread notice until 2011. Garrett McNamara rode a massive wave in Nazare in 2011, earning the title of “biggest wave ever ridden” in the Guinness Book of World Records. He smashed his own benchmark there in 2013, and Rodrigo Koxa won the title in 2017 by surfing an 80-foot wave there.</li>

            <li ><h3 class="H1">Place Name :</h3> Uluwatu, Bali, Indonesia</li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>Uluwatu, located on the Bukit Peninsula of Bali, is a legendary surf destination with powerful, peeling left-handers that break over a shallow reef. The wave at Uluwatu is consistent year-round, with the best conditions occurring during the dry season (April to October), when southwesterly swells hit the island’s shores. The main break divides into several sections, including Temples, The Peak, and Racetracks, offering waves that range from playful to challenging.</li>
            <li ><h3 class="H1">What to Expect:</h3> Uluwatu lends itself to intermediate to advanced surfers due to the fast and powerful nature of the waves. However, beginners can still enjoy smaller surf at nearby beaches like Padang Padang. The reef at Uluwatu is sharp, so booties are recommended for those unfamiliar with reef breaks.</li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Things to Do:</h3> What makes Uluwatu truly special is its amazing scenery. Nestled beneath towering limestone cliffs, the surf spots offer stunning views of the Indian Ocean amid a breathtaking backdrop. After a day of surfing, you can relax at one of the many cliffside cafes and bars, enjoying a spectacular sunset. The area is also home to the iconic Uluwatu Temple, where you can experience a traditional Kecak dance performance. Uluwatu’s combination of world-class surf and cultural richness makes it a must-visit for surfers and travellers alike.</li>

            <li ><h3 class="H1">Place Name :</h3>Cloudbreak, Fiji
</li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>Cloudbreak, located off the coast of Tavarua Island in Fiji, is one of the world’s most famous reef breaks. Known for its powerful, long, and perfectly barreling waves, Cloudbreak offers a challenging and exhilarating surf experience. The wave breaks over a shallow coral reef and can reach heights of up to 20 feet on big days, making it a magnet for advanced surfers seeking the ride of a lifetime.</li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Things to Do:</h3>What sets Cloudbreak apart is not just the wave but the idyllic setting. Surrounded by crystal-clear waters, palm-fringed islands, and luxury resorts, Fiji offers the ultimate tropical surf experience. After a day of challenging waves, surfers can relax in paradise, enjoying the island’s laid-back vibe, stunning sunsets, and warm hospitality. Whether you’re paddling out to Cloudbreak or exploring the surrounding reefs, Fiji offers a surf adventure like no other.</li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Best Time to Visit:</h3>The best time to surf Cloudbreak is during the Fijian winter (May to October), when the Southern Hemisphere swells create the ideal conditions for this world-class wave. While Cloudbreak can be intimidating, nearby breaks like Restaurants and Namotu Lefts offer more forgiving waves for intermediate surfers.</li>
