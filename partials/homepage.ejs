            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>Camping is a form of outdoor recreation or outdoor education involving overnight stays with a basic temporary shelter such as a tent. Camping can also include a recreational vehicle, sheltered cabins, a permanent tent, a shelter such as a bivy or tarp, or no shelter at all. Typically, participants leave developed areas to spend time outdoors, in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment or in a form of educational experience. Spending the night away from home distinguishes camping from day-tripping, picnicking, and other outdoor activities.
            </li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3>Planning your whole trip ahead of time to minimize safety risks.
Learning and gathering as much information about your dream destination including its possible risks.
Consulting and paying attention to all information relayed by the park’s or campground’s staff/hosts.Appreciating your physical and mental limits to eliminate avoidable safety risks.
Taking action guided by good judgement and using the right gear.</li>

            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>Cycle touring is the taking of self-contained cycling trips for pleasure, adventure or autonomy rather than sport, commuting or exercise. Bicycle touring can range from single-day trips to extended travels spanning weeks or months. Tours may be planned by the participant or organized by a tourism business, local club or organization, or a charity as a fund-raising venture.
            </li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3> Always wear a helmet, eye protection, and high-visibility clothing.Don’t ride wearing headphones. The ability to hear your surroundings is second in importance only to being able to see ahead. Have a headlight and flashing rear light. The latter makes you dramatically more noticeable to traffic approaching from behind.</li>

            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving whereby divers use breathing equipment that is completely independent of a surface breathing gas supply, and therefore has a limited but variable endurance.Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, affording them greater independence and movement than surface-supplied divers, and more time underwater than freedivers.
            </li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3>Before you go on a dive trip, make sure you’re physically fit to dive. One of the most important aspects of dive safety is ensuring your equipment is in perfect working order.Having a good dive buddy – and being a great dive buddy yourself – are vital for dive safety.</li>

            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found as standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or wave pools.
            </li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3>Choose the Right Surf Spot. Use the Right Surfboard. Wear the Right Surfing Gear.  Learn to Read the Waves.Understanding wave patterns is essential. Before paddling out, observe the waves for a while.</li>

It ranges from calm, leisurely paddling in still waters to the adrenaline-pumping excitement of navigating rapid river currents. As both a recreational activity and a competitive sport, canoeing offers a unique way to explore natural waterways, promotes physical fitness, and provides a platform for competitive athleticism.
            </li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3> Every time you get on the water, you should do a quick check. Check for holes, deep scratches or general wear and tear and make any repairs to ensure your boat is watertight before heading out.Think about floatation devices for your boat too </li>

            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>A zip line is made up of a pulley appended to a stainless-steel cable extended between fixed points of different elevations. Also known as ‘zip wire’, ‘flying fox’ and ‘Tyrolean Crossing’, it allows a person, fastened to the moving pulley, to ‘zip’ from the top to the bottom of a cable, propelled by gravity. For gravity alone to propel the user, the zip line must be inclined to a certain degree.
            </li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3>The first step in ensuring your safety is to select a reputable zipline operator. Research their safety record, read reviews, and check if they follow industry safety standards and guidelines. A well-established operator will prioritize your safety.When you arrive at the zipline location, you’ll receive instructions from experienced guides. Pay close attention to their advice and follow their directions meticulously.</li>

            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3></li>Never explore a cave solo! Having a buddy or a group not only makes the adventure more fun but also ensures safety.

            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3> kitesurfing is about harnessing the power of the wind to propel a rider across the water on a small board. But simplifying it to just wind and water does a disservice to the intricate dance that unfolds.The kite, controlled by lines and the bar in the rider’s hands, becomes an extension of the body, responding to every nuance, every shift of weight.
            </li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3>Avoid going out in conditions above your ability.  Until you have at least 30 hours on the water, 25 knots is the maximum wind you should go out in. If in doubt, don't go out.Avoid storm fronts until you have have have logged at least 30 sessions (30 hours on the water).</li>

            <li><h3 class="H1">Description:</h3>Ice climbing is an exhilarating sport that involves ascending frozen formations using specialized equipment. Imagine yourself conquering towering ice walls, crunching your crampons into solid ice, and relying on sharp ice tools to propel yourself upward. As you navigate the intricate network of ice formations, the crisp air fills your lungs, and the frozen beauty of nature surrounds you. 
            </li>
            <li><h3 class="H1">Safety Tips:</h3>Ice climbing requires a high level of physical fitness, as it engages muscles that are not typically used in other forms of climbing. To prepare your body for the demands of ice climbing, focus on building strength in your core, arms, and legs. Incorporate exercises such as pull-ups, squats, and planks into your workout routine to improve your overall strength and endurance.</li>
